-- PROJECT: Sales & Weather Analysis
-- DATABASE: sales1 
-- DESCRIPTION: 
--   This project integrates two distinct datasets—sales data and 
--   weather conditions—with the goal of enabling insightful queries 
--   that correlate weather patterns with sales performance.
--   
--   The primary objective is to understand how different weather 
--   conditions impact sales, such as whether rainy days reduce 
--   customer purchases, or if certain products sell more in specific 
--   weather scenarios.
--
--   This part of the schema defines the `orders` table, which contains 
--   detailed sales records including customer information, product 
--   details, and transactional metrics.
--
--   A separate `weather` table will later be introduced and linked 
--   to this table via shared temporal (and potentially geographic) 
--   fields like `order_date` and `city` or `state`, allowing us 
--   to perform meaningful joins and analyses.
-- =====================================================================================



-- Create the project database if it doesn't already exist
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS sales_data;

-- Create the raw orders table to hold imported sales data: 
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS sales_data.orders_raw (
    row_id INT,  -- Internal unique identifier for each row
    order_id VARCHAR(50),  -- Unique order code (may repeat if multiple items in one order; see below...)
    order_date VARCHAR(20),   -- Stored as string for format compatibility during import, (see below for optimization ...)
    ship_date VARCHAR(20),   -- Same as above for shipping date
    ship_mode VARCHAR(50),  -- How the order was shipped (first and  Standard Class)
    customer_id VARCHAR(50),  -- Unique ID for each customer
    customer_name VARCHAR(100),  -- Full name of the customer
    segment VARCHAR(50),  -- Market segment (like :  Consumer, Corporate)
    country VARCHAR(50),  -- Customer country
    city VARCHAR(50),  -- Customer city (we will use it for joining with weather data)
    state VARCHAR(50),  -- Customer state/province
    postal_code VARCHAR(20),  -- String format compatibility
    region VARCHAR(50),  -- Sales region (e.g., West, South)
    product_id VARCHAR(50),  -- Unique identifier for the product
    category VARCHAR(50),  -- Main product category
    sub_category VARCHAR(50),  -- More specific sub-category
    product_name VARCHAR(200),  -- Full descriptive name of the product
    sales DECIMAL(10,2),  -- Amount of money from the sale
    quantity INT,  -- Number of items sold
    discount DECIMAL(5,2),  -- Discount applied (0.2 for 20%)
    profit DECIMAL(10,2)  -- Profit from the transaction
);

-- SECTION: Weather Table Creation and Uniqueness Check for Order IDs
-- DESCRIPTION:
--   This section begins with a query to inspect the raw sales orders and
--   to verify whether the ⁠ order_id ⁠ can be used as a unique primary key.
--   It turns out that multiple products can be sold under the same order,
--   so ⁠ order_id ⁠ cannot be unique in this context.
--
--   Then, we create three key tables that store weather data:
--     1. temperature
--     2. humidity
--     3. description
--   Each table uses a composite primary key based on ⁠ date ⁠ and ⁠ city ⁠,
--   allowing for accurate matching between weather records and sales events.
--   Indexes are added to improve query performance during joins and filtering.


-- =======================================================================



-- Inspect the contents of the raw orders
SELECT * FROM sales1.orders_raw;

-- Check for non-unique order_ids
-- This reveals whether a single order ID may appear more than once
-- (e.g., when a customer buys multiple items in one purchase)
-- PRIMARY KEYS must be UNIQUE and NOT NULL, so we validate this here
SELECT order_id, COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM sales_data.sales_weather
GROUP BY order_id
HAVING cnt > 1
ORDER BY cnt DESC;


-- =======================================================================
-- Temperature Table : 
-- Captures daily average temperature data for each city
-- Composite key ensures uniqueness for (date, city) combinations
-- Indexes support fast lookup by city or date
-- =======================================================================

CREATE TABLE temperature (
    date DATE NOT NULL,
    city VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    temperature DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (date, city),
    INDEX idx_city (city),
    INDEX idx_date (date)
);

-- Humidity Table : 
-- Stores relative humidity readings per city per day
-- Same structure and indexing strategy as the temperature table
CREATE TABLE humidity (
    date DATE NOT NULL,
    city VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    humidity DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (date, city),
    INDEX idx_city (city),
    INDEX idx_date (date)
);

-- Weather Description Table : 
-- Records qualitative descriptions like 'Sunny', 'Rainy', etc.
-- Follows same schema structure for consistency
CREATE TABLE description (
    date DATE NOT NULL,
    city VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    description VARCHAR(50),
    PRIMARY KEY (date, city),
    INDEX idx_city (city),
    INDEX idx_date (date)
);


-- =======================================================================
-- SECTION: Weather Data Integration and Join with Sales Orders
-- DESCRIPTION:
--   In this section, we consolidate weather data from multiple sources—
--   temperature, humidity, and description—into a single structure.
--   This enables us to  join weather conditions correctly with sales data 
--   and perform analysis based on both weather and sales factors.
-- =======================================================================

-- Here we start creating a combined view (for quick reference) that joins weather components
-- Note: This query could be turned into a materialized table if performance is needed
-- CREATE VIEW sales_data.combined_weather AS
SELECT 
    t.date,
    t.city,
    t.temperature,
    h.humidity,
    d.description
FROM 
    sales_data.temperature t
JOIN 
    sales_data.humidity h ON t.date = h.date AND t.city = h.city
JOIN 
    sales_data.description d ON t.date = d.date AND t.city = h.city;

-- Create a materialized version of the above using LEFT JOINs
-- Purpose: Ensure we don't lose temperature rows even if humidity or description is missing
CREATE TABLE combined_weather1 AS
SELECT 
    t.city,
    t.date,
    t.temperature,
    h.humidity,
    d.description
FROM 
    temperature t
LEFT JOIN 
    humidity h ON t.city = h.city AND t.date = h.date
LEFT JOIN 
    description d ON t.city = d.city AND t.date = d.date;

-- Count how many records we successfully aggregated into the combined table
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM combined_weather1;

-- Benchmark query performance
-- This helps us evaluate how efficiently queries run on the combined table
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM combined_weather1;




-- =======================================================================
-- SECTION: Join Sales with Weather
-- DESCRIPTION:
--   Here, we create a new table `sales_weather` by joining weather data
--   to sales orders using city and date. Since order dates are stored
--   as strings in the `orders_raw` table, we convert them on the fly.
--   This join enables advanced sales analysis based on daily weather.
-- =======================================================================

  ON STR_TO_DATE(o.order_date, '%d/%m/%y') = w.date  -- Convert string to date for accurate join
  AND o.city = w.city;

-- Performance Check: Time it takes to read from the full joined table
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM sales_weather;  -- ~0.15 sec

-- How many rows were generated from the join?
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sales_weather;  -- Good to validate row integrity

-- DATA VALIDATION & CLEANING: sales_weather_clean
-- PURPOSE:
--   This section focuses on verifying data quality within the optimized table 
--   ⁠ sales_weather_clean ⁠. The goals are:
--     1. Identify and handle duplicate records (for ⁠row_id ⁠)
--     2. Ensure there are no NULLs in critical columns like ⁠ row_id ⁠
--     3. Investigate why ⁠ order_id ⁠ cannot be used as a PRIMARY KEY
-- ============================================================================

--   1: Check for duplicate row_id values
--    While ⁠ row_id ⁠ should ideally be unique, this check helps confirm if 
--    accidental duplication has occurred ( due to joins or multiple inserts).
SELECT 
    row_id, 
    COUNT(*) AS duplicate_count
FROM sales_data.sales_weather_clean
GROUP BY row_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
LIMIT 10;

-- INSIGHT: Only 2 duplicate row_ids were found.
--    These should be manually reviewed and removed if necessary to ensure data consistency.

--   2: Check for NULL values in the ⁠ row_id ⁠ field
--    We want to confirm that all rows have a valid row identifier.
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM sales_data.sales_weather_clean 
WHERE row_id IS NULL;

-- RESULT: Zero NULL values were found. This means all rows have valid identifiers.

--  3: Remove the specific rows identified as duplicates
--    (Note: Not shown here, but you would use DELETE with a WHERE condition 
--    or use ROW_NUMBER in a CTE to retain only the first instance.)

-- ============================================================================
-- PERFORMANCE TEST: Evaluate execution speed of full table scan
--    The goal is to ensure that our optimizations (indexing) are effective.
-- ============================================================================

-- Measure the execution plan and timing for a full table read
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM sales_weather_clean;

-- Example Result: 0.08 sec (previous version without indexes took nearly twice as long)

-- Quick check: How many rows are in the optimized table?
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sales_weather_clean;

-- ============================================================================
-- 🔍 BONUS VALIDATION: Why ⁠ order_id ⁠ cannot be UNIQUE
-- CONTEXT:
--   In a real sales system, a single order (order_id) may contain multiple products.
--   Therefore, order_id can repeat across rows — it's not a good candidate for PRIMARY KEY.
-- ============================================================================

-- Check how many order_ids appear more than once
SELECT 
    order_id, 
    COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM sales_data.sales_weather
GROUP BY order_id
HAVING cnt > 1
ORDER BY cnt DESC;

-- RESULT: Many order_ids appear multiple times.
--    Example: An order with 3 different items will result in 3 separate rows,
--    all sharing the same ⁠ order_id ⁠ but differing in ⁠ product_id ⁠ and details.
--    ➤ This is why we avoided setting ⁠ order_id ⁠ as a UNIQUE constraint or PRIMARY KEY.

--   we can identify which sub-categories perform best under specific 
--   weather descriptions (like :  "Rain", "Sunny", and more ....)
--
--   This kind of analysis can support data-driven decisions like:
--     - targeted promotions based on forecasted weather
--     - optimizing inventory during certain climate conditions
--     - identifying product trends tied to seasonal weather
-- ============================================================================

-- QUERY 12: Category-Level Product Performance by Weather Type
-- PURPOSE:
--   This query extends the analysis of product sales by weather condition, 
--   focusing on higher-level product categories (as : Furniture, Technology).
--
--   While Query 11 analyzed sub-categories, here we generalize to observe 
--   broader trends—such as whether entire product categories perform better 
--   under certain weather types.
--
--   This is useful to:

-- QUERY 13: Top 5 Best-Selling Products per Weather Condition
-- PURPOSE:
--   This query identifies the top 5 products (in terms of total sales)

--     - What do people buy most often when it's sunny, rainy, or foggy?
--     - Are there product trends tied to specific weather patterns?
--
--   The goal is to uncover weather-based purchasing preferences

-- PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION: Sales Analysis under Clear Weather Conditions
--
-- GOAL:
--   to analyze the average sales per region specifically when the weather is 
--   described as 'sky is clear'. This helps assess if sales perform better 
--   in sunny, favorable conditions.
--
-- CHALLENGE:
--   The original query performs a full index scan on `sales_weather_clean`, 
--   evaluating thousands of rows but using only a portion (43%) of them, 
--   resulting in unnecessary resource usage and slower performance.
--
-- STRATEGY:
--   Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to assess query cost and identify inefficiencies.
--   Then improve performance by creating targeted indexes.
-- ================================================================================

-- STEP 1: Performance Diagnostics with EXPLAIN ANALYZE
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT /*+ SET_VAR(max_execution_time=30000) */
    region,
    AVG(sales) AS avg_sales
FROM sales_data.sales_weather_clean
WHERE weather_description = 'sky is clear'
GROUP BY region;

-- SAMPLE PLAN OUTPUT:
-- -> Group aggregate: avg(sales_weather_clean.sales)
--    (cost=411 rows=4) (actual time=7.96..12.5 rows=4 loops=1)
--     -> Filter: (weather_description = 'sky is clear')
--        (cost=376 rows=352) (actual time=2.07..12.1 rows=1563 loops=1)
--         -> Index scan on sales_weather_clean using idx_region
--            (cost=376 rows=3515) (actual time=1.99..11.5 rows=3616 loops=1)

-- INTERPRETATION:
--   Although an index is used (`idx_region`), it's not selective enough.
--   The table reads over 3,600 rows but keeps only 1,563 (~43%) — not efficient.

-- STEP 2: Create a Composite Index to Improve Filtering Efficiency
--   This index helps by covering both the `weather_description` used in WHERE 
--   and the `region` used in GROUP BY.

CREATE INDEX idx_weather_region ON sales_weather_clean (weather_description, region);

-- FURTHER OPTIMIZATION:
--   Add `sales` to the index if you're aggregating it directly,
--   enabling index-only scans in some DBMS.

CREATE INDEX idx_weather_region_sales ON sales_weather_clean 
(weather_description, region, sales);

-- STEP 3: Run the Original Query Again After Index Creation
--   Expecting faster performance now due to the better use of filtered index.

EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT 
    region,
    AVG(sales) AS avg_sales
FROM sales_weather_clean
WHERE weather_description = 'sky is clear'
GROUP BY region;

-- STEP 4: Force the Index (Optional - only if the DBMS does not pick the new index automatically)

-- This query hints to MySQL to use the index we just created
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT /*+ INDEX(swc idx_weather_region) */
    region,
    AVG(sales) AS avg_sales
FROM sales_weather_clean swc
WHERE weather_description = 'sky is clear'
GROUP BY region;

-- OPTIONAL: Create a View for Reusability
-- You could encapsulate this analysis in a view for further reporting

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW avg_sales_by_clear_weather AS
SELECT 
    region,
    AVG(sales) AS avg_sales
FROM sales_weather_clean
WHERE weather_description = 'sky is clear'
GROUP BY region;

-- Now this is accessible via:
SELECT * FROM avg_sales_by_clear_weather;
